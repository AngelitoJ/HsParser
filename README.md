HsParser
===========

A universal Parsec based, parser toy inspired by pandoc and aimed at parsing heterogeneous formats

This is a testbed application for diferent parsers, its current uses include:

1) A Generic parsing tool aimed at automatic parsec based generation of line oriented formats

2) A Email parsing tool

3) A Quantum Chemistry, basis exchange file parsing tool for the HaskellFock Project (https://github.com/felipeZ/Haskell-abinitio)

This app is based around another toy of us called BareBones (to be releases) a complete Haskell console
application, with built-in geopt capabilities and other goodies.
