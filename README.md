HsParser
===========

A universal Parsec based, parser toy inspired by pandoc and aimed at parsing heterogeneous formats

This is a testbed application for diferent parsers, its current uses include:

1) A Universal parser tool aimed at automatic parsec based generation of line oriented formats

2) A genereic Email envelope parsing tool

3) A Computational Chemistry:
  - EMSL basis exchange files, used in the HaskellFock Project (https://github.com/felipeZ/Haskell-abinitio)
  - Molcas output parser tool, used in HsDynamics (https://github.com(AngelitoJ/HsDynamics)
  - Gaussian 2k3 Chekpointing parsing tool, used in HsDynamics

This app is based around another of my pets projectscalled HsApp (The BareBones app)
